# Day 1 – 5 : Getting Started with Python

These are my first few days of learning Python as part of my 100 Days of Code journey focused on AI and Machine Learning.

In these days I was mainly trying to understand the basics and get comfortable with writing code. Most of the files here are small practice programs, experiments, and notes while learning. Nothing too big yet — just building the foundation.

## What I Learned / Practiced

- Variables and basic data types  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Strings and string methods  
- Lists and list operations  
- if–else conditions  
- for and while loops  
- Functions  
- Taking user input  
- **NumPy** for arrays and calculations  
- **Pandas** for handling simple datasets 

## About the Files

These files are not full projects.  
They are practice codes, small logic tests, and examples I wrote while understanding concepts. Some are messy, some are simple — but they show my real learning process.

## Why This Folder Exists

I wanted to keep a record of where I started instead of only showing polished projects later.  
These first 5 days helped me get comfortable with Python before moving towards Data Analysis and Machine Learning topics.

This is basically the starting point of my AIML journey.
