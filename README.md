# 100 Days of AI / ML

Hi, I’m Tanishk.  
This repository documents my **#100DaysOfCode journey focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.

I started this challenge to build strong fundamentals in AI/ML, practice consistently, and work on real datasets and projects that reflect practical understanding rather than only theory.

## What This Repository Contains

This repo is a structured record of my daily and phase-wise learning, including:

- Python programming fundamentals
- Data analysis using NumPy and Pandas
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Supervised Machine Learning  
- Regression
- Classification
- Unsupervised Machine Learning  
- Clustering techniques
- Dimensionality Reduction  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Practice on real-world datasets
- Mini and end-to-end machine learning projects
- and in progress to Deep Learning
