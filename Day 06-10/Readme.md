# Day 6 – 10 : Machine Learning Basics Progress

This part of my #100DaysOfCode journey was mainly about getting comfortable with core Machine Learning algorithms and actually implementing them instead of only reading theory.  
I tried to keep things practical so I could understand *how* models work, not just what they are.

## What I Learned

### Day 6 – Logistic Regression
- Got the basic idea of classification problems
- Understood the intuition behind Logistic Regression
- Learned how the sigmoid function works
- Trained a simple Logistic Regression model on sample datasets
- Evaluated results using accuracy and confusion matrix

### Day 7 – KNN & Distance Concepts
- Learned how the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm works
- Understood Euclidean distance and neighbor selection
- Implemented KNN with different **k values**
- Observed how accuracy changes when k changes

### Day 8 – Decision Trees
- Learned how Decision Trees split the dataset
- Basic understanding of entropy and information gain
- Built a Decision Tree classifier
- Compared training accuracy vs testing accuracy

### Day 9 – Random Forest
- Learned basics of ensemble learning
- Understood why multiple trees are often better than one
- Implemented Random Forest classifier
- Compared performance with Decision Tree

### Day 10 – Model Evaluation & Comparison
- Practiced proper train-test split
- Used classification report and confusion matrix
- Compared multiple models on the same dataset
- Focused on understanding **precision, recall, and F1-score**

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn

## Key Takeaways

- Different algorithms behave differently on different datasets.
- Evaluation metrics are just as important as training the model.
- Ensemble methods like Random Forest often give more stable results.
- Actually implementing models makes theory much easier to understand.

This phase helped me move from “just learning Python” to actually feeling like I’m stepping into real Machine Learning.
